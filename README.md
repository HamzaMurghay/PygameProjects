# PygameProjects


Points to Note: (For Rock Paper Scissors Simulator)

1) This program will spawn 33 rock, papers and scissors each and allows a full on battle to see which can win and take the lead, this program was inspired by a youtube short, link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPGI4UkNcKw, the program works by making the rock paper and scissor objects respectively go after their defeatable enemy (example: rock is strong against scissors, same with scissors towards paper etc.) and also avoid their undefeatable enemy (paper in rock's case, rock in scissors case) when they get closer than a certain distance

2) You can either click the play button to start the program and in the same way click the pause button when you want the program to pause its execution OR you can press the space bar in order to more easily and quickly start and stop the program as you like

3) Similar to the play button, you can click the reset button to restart the simulation and spawn a new set of rocks, papers and scissors OR press 'r' on your keyboard to do it through keys

4) The Three main text boxes at the center-top of the screen show the number of rocks, papers and scissors respectively

5) The implementation to turn off the enemy avoiding algorithm will soon be added but as of yet is not available

6) You can increase the speed of the program/fast forward through it by pressing 'f', the implementation to fast forward by clicking the fast forward button will soon be added
   

Points to Note: (For Rainbow Bouncing Square)

1) The program will not run unless you press the space bar, so if the program seems to be stationary/ frozen on start-up, try pressing the space bar

2) Enjoy the satisfying patterns and sounds created by the program for your pleasue :)
